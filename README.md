# Issues-Demo

Demonstrates how to use Issues to trigger automations

1. Add a new Issue and select the "Create Repo" Issue Template
2. Add your repo name to the form and create the issue

This will create a new repo, add a topic to the repo, and close the isse.

What this needs in place is:

1. An Issue Template in a .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES folder of the repo
2. A workflow that triggers on an issue being opened

Both of these items can be seen in this repo
